# Sidebar: sections, starring, drag-and-drop + tab coding status (2026-08-26)

Plan: /Users/eddie/.claude/plans/silly-petting-puppy.md

- [x] Part A: tab status word — TabStatus enum on TabModel, set in AppModel/WindowController, label in TabRow
- [x] B1: Support.swift — ProjectSection, ProjectMeta, SidebarMeta, loadMeta/saveMeta
- [x] B2: Support.swift — autoSection + sectioned pure functions
- [x] B3: ContentView.swift — ProjectRow extraction (star button + context menu), sectioned idle rendering, LazyVStack, search-mode flat list, onSubmit fix
- [x] B4: ContentView.swift — ProjectRowDrop / ProjectSectionDrop, liveMove/commitDrop, TabReorderDrop hardening, container onDrop clears both drags
- [x] Build + diff review — full diff verified against plan (Fable); unsigned `xcodebuild` BUILD SUCCEEDED
- [x] Fix local signing: Debug uses macOS/KnifeMacDev.entitlements (no iCloud/push) + Zelig team 5VY7X6W92A; Release keeps CW&T entitlements (now per-config CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS in project.yml — the xcodegen `entitlements:` block forced one file on all configs). `make mac` + `make install-mac` work again.
- [ ] Manual QA per plan checklist — app installed to /Applications, relaunch to test. Note: locally built Debug apps have CloudKit disabled (runtime guard), so no iOS sync from dev builds.

## Review

- Full diff across the 5 files reviewed against the approved plan — matches (Part A status word; Part B sections/star/drag-drop, order-array + override semantics as designed).
- `xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build` → BUILD SUCCEEDED.
- The CloudKit-entitlement guard in AppModel.swift init is Eddie's pre-existing uncommitted change (verified via relay transcript: seen in a read, not authored) — untouched.
- **Blocker for QA/install**: `make mac` (signed) fails at provisioning before compiling — "No Accounts" + no profile for `com.cwandt.knifeterminal` for CLI xcodebuild. Pre-existing environment state (possibly since the hardened-runtime change, 47ed32b), not caused by these edits. Build from Xcode.app or add the account for CLI builds, then run the QA checklist in the plan.

## Fix round 2 — sidebar project drag felt broken in use (2026-08-27)

Manual QA finally happened (Eddie: "moving projects around in sidebar is not working well").
Five defects found in `apple/macOS/ContentView.swift`, all fixed:

- [x] **Drag start cancelled/glitched.** `.onDrag` wrote `@State` synchronously, re-rendering the
      row while AppKit was opening the drag session. Now deferred via `DispatchQueue.main.async`
      (both project rows and tab rows).
- [x] **List reflowed the instant you picked a row up.** Empty section headers were revealed by
      `|| draggingProject != nil`, pushing every row down mid-drag so the row under the cursor was
      no longer the one grabbed. Headers now always render — layout is fixed while dragging.
- [x] **Drops that snapped back.** The container-level `.onDrop` discarded the live order with a
      bare `rebuild()`, and a project released over the tab list hit `TabReorderDrop`, which
      committed nothing. All four drop targets now funnel through one `endDrag()` that persists
      whatever order is on screen, so releasing anywhere in the sidebar sticks.
- [x] **Section-header drops landed by recency, not where dropped.** Header hover now live-moves
      the row to the top of that section (`liveMove(_:into:)`) and the drop snapshots that order.
- [x] **Two parallel drag optionals** (`draggingTabId` / `draggingProject`) with identical
      `public.plain-text` payloads → replaced by one `SidebarDrag` enum, so a tab dragged over a
      project row (or the reverse) can't be misread as a drag of the target's own kind.
- [x] `commitDrop` takes the path explicitly instead of writing `@State` and reading it back in
      the same call (context-menu "move to …" relied on that round-trip).

Verified: `xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` and `make mac` (signed) both BUILD SUCCEEDED.
The provisioning blocker noted in the previous round is gone — signed CLI builds work again.
Still needs a hands-on pass in the running app: `make install-mac`, relaunch, drag within a
section, across sections, onto a header, onto a collapsed header, and onto blank space.

# Restore every working Claude tab on relaunch (2026-09-09)

Problem: session.json only carries `cmd` for tabs opened from the sidebar (`claude -c`), so
tabs where `claude` was started by hand come back as bare shells, and `-c` resumes "most
recent in cwd" — two tabs in the same project both resume the same conversation.

- [ ] TabModel: `claudeSessionId` (from hook payloads) + `claudeRunning` (pgrep under the tab's shell)
- [ ] AppModel.handleSocketMessage: record `session_id` per tab; clear on SessionEnd
- [ ] saveSession: cmd = `claude --resume <id>` if known, else `claude -c` if claude is live, else restoreCmd
- [ ] SavedTab.fixed: keep the project name pinned only for sidebar-opened tabs (legacy files keep old rule)
- [ ] Build + install

# iOS mirror without CW&T (2026-09-09)

Zelig (5VY7X6W92A) is a paid team, so both apps run under Zelig ids and Zelig's own container:
- [x] CloudSync.containerID reads KnifeCloudContainer (Info.plist ← KNIFE_CLOUD_CONTAINER build setting), CW&T default
- [x] Makefile: XCODEBUILD_FLAGS_IOS + `make install-ios` (devicectl) — committed, pushed to the PR branch
- [x] local.mk (gitignored): com.zelig.knifeterminal / .ios, iCloud.com.zelig.knifeterminal, *.zelig.entitlements (git-excluded), IOS_DEVICE = EC PRO
- [x] Mac: built, installed to /Applications with Zelig container + push entitlements (Xcode auto-provisioning created the App ID + container)
- [x] iOS: built, installed on EC PRO via devicectl
- [ ] Eddie: relaunch Knife on the Mac, open Knife on the phone (same Apple ID as the Mac, eddiemc27@mac.com), confirm tabs appear
- [x] iOS restyle to match the Mac: KnifeStyle.swift (ui()/mono(), TermTheme.current(scheme), RGB→Color), Helvetica Now bundled locally (apple/Fonts/HelveticaNow*, git-excluded), theme backgrounds/accent/attention throughout; built + installed on EC PRO

# Session board (2026-09-09)

One screen with every live agent session as a card: status, the last exchange from its
transcript, and a reply box that types straight into that tab. ⌘⇧B / footer "board" toggles it
in place of the terminal pane; click a card header to jump into the tab.

- [ ] TabModel.runningAgent ("claude" | "codex" | nil) via the existing pgrep; claudeRunning = runningAgent == "claude"
- [ ] TranscriptReader.messages(forCwd:sessionId:) — exact ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl when the tab's session id is known, else the newest-in-cwd fallback; chatData(forCwd:sessionId:) wraps it; SyncPublisher passes tab.claudeSessionId
- [ ] KnifeWindowController.showBoard (@Published); AppDelegate View ▸ "Session Board" ⌘⇧B; FooterBar "board" button
- [ ] ContentView: board replaces TerminalPane when showBoard
- [ ] BoardView.swift: adaptive grid of SessionCard (needs-input first), 2 s transcript refresh off the main thread, reply field (text, then CR 0.25 s later, like the phone), header tap → activate tab + close board
- [x] Build + install (signed Debug, BUILD SUCCEEDED) — hands-on check pending Eddie's relaunch

# iOS: readability, status grouping, alerts off (2026-09-10)

- [x] No more one-line truncation: session + project titles wrap to two lines; the nav bar
      shows the full title (middle-truncated) with the project folder beneath it; tool lines
      in the chat expand on tap
- [x] Sessions grouped: needs input / working / idle, counts in the headers, attention color
      on the first — same order as the Mac sidebar and board
- [x] Each row carries the last exchange (Claude's newest reply, or the tool it's running),
      decoded once per sync into a snippet map rather than per row on scroll
- [x] Mirror readability: prose wraps on words, box drawing still on characters; text-size
      menu (small/medium/large) plus "fit Mac width", which solves for the size that makes
      the Mac's own column count fit — landscape then shows the desktop layout unwrapped
- [x] Cleanups: "projects" header is a header again (the sentence moved to a footer), the
      internal device label is gone from the footer
- [x] Notifications: visible pushes are opt-in behind a switch, default off — the alert
      subscription is deleted server-side and the badge cleared when off. Silent sync pushes
      are untouched, so the mirror stays as fresh as before.

# Sidebar grouping is buggy + "active" = worked on in the last 24h (2026-09-14)

Eddie: "its super buggy. also active should be projects that have been worked on in the past 24 hours"

Defects found by reading (grouping shipped without driving the app — see lessons.md):
1. Tab drag across groups: moveTab reorders the flat array but rows are shown grouped, so the
   row doesn't go where dropped and the list reflows under the cursor mid-drag.
2. Clicking a ready / needs-input tab resets its status, so the row jumps out from under the
   cursor into another group. Focusing the window does the same to the current tab.
3. Every keystroke sets status .idle, so a working tab you type into flaps working ↔ active.
4. active/dormant hung off a 3 s process scan: new sessions flash dormant → active.
5. Board cards push/pop the pointing-hand cursor; a card reordering while hovered unbalances
   the stack and the cursor sticks (same bug on the sidebar resize handle).

Plan:
- [x] TabModel.lastActivity (hook events, typing, open), persisted in session.json
- [x] Groups: needs input · working · ready · active (touched < 24h) · dormant — no process scan
- [x] Selected tab keeps the group it was clicked in until you switch away or its status truly changes
- [x] Tab drag only reorders within the dragged tab's group
- [x] Typing clears ready/needs-input but not working unless it's Esc or ^C (interrupts send no Stop hook)
- [x] Cursor: onContinuousHover + set() instead of push/pop (board cards, resize handle)
- [x] Projects: active = touched in the last 24h (was 30 days)
- [x] Build + install (BUILD SUCCEEDED); 14 logic checks pass against the extracted source
      (groups, 24h boundary both sides, old session file, lastActive round-trip, interrupt bytes)
- [ ] Hands-on pass by Eddie: click a ready tab (row should stay put), drag within and across
      groups, type into a working tab, Esc a working tab, hover board cards then move away

## Follow-up: "when clicking on an item in active it doesnt highlight" (2026-09-14)

Cause: the highlight was correct (it marks the clicked tab id) but the row wasn't under the
pointer anymore. The selection pin from the previous round unpinned the old selection on the
next click; that tab left "ready", landed in "active", and shifted the rows being clicked by one.
Hook events on other sessions also reflowed the groups above "active" mid-press.

- [x] Remove the selection pin (WindowController.pinned / displayGroup / sameGroup)
- [x] Freeze group membership while the pointer is over the tab list; order stays live for drags
- [x] Unfreeze on hover exit (animated) and on window resign-key (parked pointer never exits)
- [x] Drag guard compares the group shown on screen, via a closure from the sidebar
- [x] Build + install
- [ ] Hands-on by Eddie: open a ready tab, then click a row in active — highlight should be on
      the row under the pointer; move the pointer off the sidebar and the opened tab slides to active

## 2026-09-25 — merge upstream v1.2.6–v1.2.30 (chat view, git panel, prompts, transcripts)

- [x] Fetch origin (Che-Wei) — 25 commits, 28 files; 10 conflicting files
- [x] Resolve: keep grouped sidebar/board/Helvetica chrome, take chat view + git panel + screen prompts + incremental transcript reader
  - one session-id tracker: upstream's `TabModel.sessionId` (set from any hook, cleared on SessionEnd); my `restoreCommand` still checks claude is running before `--resume`
  - `BoardView` + `SyncPublisher` read transcripts through upstream's `TranscriptReader.source/chat` (hook-reported path, sibling tabs excluded)
  - footer: upstream's bordered buttons in `ui()`; `terminal | chat | board` is one segment
  - project rows: upstream's Finder / repo-page links appended to my rename/star/move menu (`ProjectRow.links`)
  - iOS: upstream's greyed echo + prompt card mapped onto `theme.accent/attention` (my fork dropped `knifeAccent`); tool detail shows when the row is expanded
  - typing still doesn't clear `working` (my flap fix); it does clear `limited`
- [x] `make mac` BUILD SUCCEEDED · `make ios` BUILD SUCCEEDED · KnifeKit `swift test` 9/9
- [ ] Not run live (Claude runs inside Knife — Eddie relaunches): `make install-mac`, then check chat view ⌘⌥C, git panel ⌘⌥B, board segment, a permission prompt in chat, project right-click links
- [ ] Decide: leave ChatPane/GitPanel in Space Mono (upstream) or move their chrome to `ui()` — left as upstream for now to keep future merges clean
